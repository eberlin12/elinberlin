## Project 1

\par I am currently working on a projcet looking at how people talk about honor based violence on twitter. Honor based violence is salient issue in European politics, and I am interested in looking at how voters discuss the issue.I primarily look at countries in the EU, and have started out with looking at the United Kingdom in particular. 

\par Below I created a word cloud based on 550 tweets from April 13, 2023. For the next part of this analysis I would like to conduct a larger sentiment analysis of the tweets, as well as plot the networks of who speaks about these issues.
